# Scavenge and Survive - "Explorar e Sobreviver"

## Overview

`Explorar e Sobreviver` is almost the literal translation of the gamemode's name.

Scavenge and Survive is PvP survival gamemode for _SA-MP_ (now [open.mp](https://open.mp)), created by [Southclaws](https://github.com/Southclaws). It was forked for a Brazilian community.

It has about 1600 commits for features and fixes that I will not be going over in this README. Look it up yourself if you're still interested in this gamemode.
